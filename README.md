# UnblockedGamez
I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE NOW.GG TEAM. This is a file that lets you play unblocked games on a school computer. Add me on discord (! deepestfried#8732) if you want me to add more games.


Ok here is how to set up the program.

#1: Unzip the folder
#2: Move into documents partition (Windows) or keep in downloads (ChromeOS/Linux)
#3: Open Roblox.html or Minecraft.html and enjoy violating school rules.

You can also use this if you have a shityy pc that cannot run these games or linux.

Enjoy, my friends.
